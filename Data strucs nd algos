* Data structures : Diffrent methods of putting information of our computers .

* Algorithms : opertations on deffrent data structures and sets the ways for executing them .

* the value of int is stored as 32 bits on memory                    a bit = 1 or 0

* memory is a long tape of bytes and and each byte equal 8 bits 

* Object is the variables = attributes ( name , age ) and functions = methods ( sleep , walk ) that refer to someone .

* Class is a blue print where we can classify our similar objects in sort of organising .

* Array : an array is a variable that can store multiple values.

* Linked list :  is a way to store a collection of elements. Like an array these can be character or integers
                 Each element in a linked list is stored in the form of a node.

* doubly-linked list is where the connectios goes both ways in opposition the simple linked list which goes 
                     in just one side . 
                    
* Factorial : to multiply all whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1.

* Fibonacci sequence : it's a sequence of numbers that starts with two ones (1.1) at thr beginnig 
                       and the numbers after that generated by adding up the two previous numbers .
                       F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) if n â‰¥ 3
                    
* Recursion : the process of reapiting items in self similiar way .
                       
* Big O notation : is the most common metr way to calculate time complexity.
                   It describes the execution time of a task corresponding to the quantity of steps needed to finish it.
                   
* Trees : A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that contains nodes connected by edges.

* binary search : is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array.

* Quicksort : is an algorithm based on divide and conquer approach in which the array is split into subarrays 
              and these sub-arrays are recursively called to sort the elements.
              
* Stack : It is just like a pile of plates kept on top of each other.
          If you want the plate at the bottom, you have to first remove all the plates on top .
          
* Queue : It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue 
          is the first person who gets the ticket.           

* hash table : is a data structure that represents data in the form of key-value pairs. 
               Each key is related to a value in the hash table.
