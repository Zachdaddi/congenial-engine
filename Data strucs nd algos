* Data structures : Diffrent methods of putting information of our computers .

* Algorithms : opertations on deffrent data structures and sets the ways for executing them .

* the value of int is stored as 32 bits on memory                    a bit = 1 or 0

* memory is a long tape of bytes and and each byte equal 8 bits 

* Object is the variables = attributes ( name , age ) and functions = methods ( sleep , walk ) that refer to someone .

* Class is a blue print where we can classify our similar objects in sort of organising .

* Array : an array is a variable that can store multiple values.

* Linked list :  is a way to store a collection of elements. Like an array these can be character or integers
                 Each element in a linked list is stored in the form of a node.

* doubly-linked list is where the connectios goes both ways in opposition the simple linked list which goes 
                     in just one side . 
                    
* Factorial : to multiply all whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1.

* Fibonacci sequence : it's a sequence of numbers that starts with two ones (1.1) at thr beginnig 
                       and the numbers after that generated by adding up the two previous numbers .
                       F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) if n â‰¥ 3
                    
* Recursion : the process of reapiting items in self similiar way .
